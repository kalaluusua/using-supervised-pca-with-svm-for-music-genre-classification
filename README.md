# Using supervised PCA with SVM for music genre classification 

This data analysis project is a part of a Aalto University course, Machine Learning: Basic Principles. The project focuses on a multiclass musical genre classification problem. Pre-extracted summary characteristics of the data are further preprocessed using a median absolute deviation based feature selection method and supervised principal component analysis. The prediction power of a support vector machine is optimized using micro-averaged f1-score and multiclass logarithmic loss as evaluation metrics. We succesfully predict the labels of the majority classes, while compromising minority class prediction accuracy. This is deemed acceptable as the data are significantly skewed.

## Format

This project uses IPYNB format. An IPYNB file is a notebook document used by Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment designed to help scientists work with the Python language and their data.
